# NLP Wine Review Classification With LSTM Neural Network
### Schuyler Blasy

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Description
This NLP project shows how using a LSTM neural network, along with word beddings, one can reasonably predict between good and bad wine reviews, which can be applied to other NLP use cases. The model was able to simultaneously achieve over a 91% accuracy and over 80% precision in making predictions. 

### Methods Used
