# NLP Wine Review Classification With a LSTM Neural Network
### Schuyler Blasy

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Description
This NLP project shows how using a LSTM neural network, along with word beddings, one can reasonably predict between good and bad wine reviews, which can be applied to other NLP use cases. 

In addition to text features from the wine reviews, the model also uses numeric features, wine price and the number of words per description, concatenated into the neural network. The combined text and numeric features significantly increases performance, and was able to achieve over a 94% accuracy and over 83% precision on the validation set.
